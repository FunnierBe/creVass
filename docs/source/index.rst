creVass - Social Plumbing
=========================

*We can tell by your smile that you are happy to see us ... and we haven't even bent over and exposed all of our cleavage yet!*  

The RSSisant is a game changer in social network ... because it enables smart, hypernetworked plumbing ... your shitter will never be lonely again. This is a lot like when Dave Lennox invented indoor heating so that people could crap in water; they started flushing their turds and became terrified of running out of toilet paper. 

We at creVass claim that our RSSistant will do for lives that are led according to recommendation engines and sentiment analysis what indoor plumbing did for the world of real estate. 

**creVass is the AI-driven MOVEMENT ... it's the plumbing/HVAC micro-aggression news aggregator you've have been waiting for!**

Maybe you waiting for a different kind of a movement ... well, hear this one out!

Don't you need an ongoing core dump to cross-fertilize your ideas in ways you didn't foresee, plan or particularly want ... *does a bear shit in the woods?*

**creVass is like a plumbing SURPRISE ... except that it's social ... and thus more crowdly and smarter than you are!**

*After creVass ... you may never look at two guys uncomfortably crammed into a tight stall in the MSP airport in the same way again ... *

This intell scooper is AI-driven using content metadata infused with crowdsourced commentary, which is sorta like StackOverflow, except this is plumbing intell, so you know it has traces of cannabis and some of the good stuff in its UA ... a smartRSS feedreader on AI 'roids.

Seriously, it is something of a troubleshooting knowledge-graph infused with a dose of levity ... just enough humorous asshat commentary from the HVAC tech peanut gallery, to occasionally be unintentionally useful in ways that asshat does not understand himself.

At it's core, it's an RSSistant ... a tool which YOU configure ... starting with YOUR best Plumbing Intell content feeds ... but also editing out the noise.

The creVass RSSistant will do its business [working in the background, like a progressive web app fetching content from a CDN] getting you YOUR **detailed** intell, eg schematics, techdox, idiotic YouTube commentary, fora discussions, etc ... 

But it will get disgusting smarter ... learning from YOUR sources, from your CURATED datafeeds, your fuck-ups, your bad relationships, all of the stupid shit that you have gotten yourself into ... to cough up furr balls that are precisely-related to what you are working on ... and when your creVass is not as sweet and clean as you want it to be, you are in control of making it sweeter and cleaner.

The AI is there to to help you with troubleshooting, but YOU build the AI and curate/optimize the data/models which drive the answers you pull out of your creVass.

So creVass is somewhat like a more pure, less evil, more helpful, less-annoying, recommendation-engine-driven browser ... which Chromium/Chrome *could be* if the folks at AlphaF*** actually wanted to help, *without bending people over* and exposing people to all kinds of CRIMINAL info rookter violations ... in other words, creVass is the open *no, actually, it's REALLY* OPEN kind of *open* source extensible library you can visit without catching something. 

And YOU control the development and infrastructure-as-code, ie you can host the infrusture from your box, laptop, IoT device or even just your Linux/Android phone.

So, unlike your favorite browser, you are not giving someone the bandwidth to hang you with ... it's just pure stream of nothing but txt with no scripting bs that can get into your creVass -- you can shoot pictures, take videos as data inputs for your AI to use -- but everything about the architecture of your creVass can be CLEAN and SECURE ... and a CLEAN creVass means that **NOBODY else will have any reason to have their nose up YOUR private creVass!**

Sip from creVass every day for your dose of annoying, but obvious intelligence ... the kind of simplistic conspiracy theory crap that everybody sorta knows, but would rather blame on their favorite people to blame stuff on. 

It's not really any different than those engineering handbook instructions used by HVAC installers as kneepads ... when HVAC techs are installing a furnace exhaust wrong ... and it works because the service calls keep coming.

Let's just get to root cause and actually FIX this so that it stays fixed ... along the way, maybe we can ask ourselves why we thought that complexicating and hiding shit was a good idea *but let's not get too political, right off the bat ...*.

Dump your fuzzy syrup-picture AI  
================================

**Knock off the fuzzification!**

Plumbing has always been about covering up stuff so that nobody knows how that shit goes together.  It's the same with stuff like artificial intelligence or maybe worse. 

Actually, it's pretty simple ... creVass AI is about SIMPLIFICATION, which is tough for people to understand because people like believing things are more complicated than they are.

*Stop just repeating those idiotic excesses of conventional AI approaches.* creVass is not about a text-to-picture app that draws a diagram of how you are going to murder the dumbass who installed your furnace exhaust bassackward!

Just assess the situation, take some readings, learn how to turn that multimeter on and put batteries in, use the right end of a screwdriver and try to deal with Reality as Reality really is ... and laugh about the NATE-certified idiots out there smoking dope on their way to service calls and using engineering instructions as kneepads because they can't focus on anything long enough to read it.

Mostly, creVass is about helping you to just **THINK** ... to relax and just THINK about what you are doing, *WHY you are doing it,* **WHY you're a loser and your life is fucked and you are always going to be stuck doing this!** 

No ... stop it!  THINK with intention and discipline. Think outside the fast-food schlocky bun, don't overprocess or *lay on that extra sauce* to obfuscate with irrelevant data ... don't just swallow the same old s*** ... think *fast* ... *remove*, **Remove,** **REMOVE!!!**

When you are done removing, take a nap, go for a walk, meditate ... then come back and REMOVE SOME MORE ... and then polish and shine and polish and shine and polish and shine to and make sure the smell is gone and the flow will scour clean.

PRACTICAL troubleshooting and solving REAL problems is about using clarity to remove ADDICTION ... bad data just like extra drugs makes addiction, the side-effects and the addictions to the drugs for the side-effects worse ... **GET CLEAN** *or die*.


Genuine intelligence all comes down to the CLEAVAGE of REMOVAL.
===============================================================

Stop searching for another obfuscation, another imaginary fix, another drug, another product, another comfortable addiction. If you want to REALLY get at the solution a problem, you cannot simply cover it or worse automate your the covering in your litter box.

You must start by removing, CLEAVING, hack stuff out of the away to get down to where the VALUE is ... getting down in the Big V is about what really understanding what is making things smell.

After you actually understand the problem ... don't cover it up with a bandaid ... cleaning it up, polish it, make it shine so that you can see what is not shining ... make it extra CLEAN, extra shiny so that it is scrubbale and MAINTAINABLE.
People want to crap in something that is CLEAN, tightly refactored and and something that can get even CLEANER with more use.

GET DOWN INTO THE INTERNALS
===========================


You have to get down into the deep Whys of why things happen ... or, else you're just fuzzying up your networks of neurotic neurosis ... putting your diffuser bandaid on things does not reveal anything -- you're transforming the problem into a more impenetrable clusterfuck of complexification ... it might be ugly, but somebody is going to have to clean up the mess you  made!

Stop making all kinds of things worse with your ARTIFICIAL intelligence ... everyone can see that sort of intelligence is completely artificial in so many different dimensions ... knock it the fuck off with the obfuscations already.

Think *fast* ... *remove*, **Remove,** **REMOVE!!!**
