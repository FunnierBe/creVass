*Relax, take a deep breath ... we haven't even bent over and exposed our cleavage yet!*

*creVass* is an AI-driven plumbing/HVAC micro-aggression framework ... an RSS feed newsreader, with a *NOSE* for the good stuff.

Sip from creVass every day for your dose of annoying, but obvious intelligence ... the kind of stuff everybody knows, but would rather not think about. 

t's just like those engineering handbook instructions used by HVAC installers as kneepads ... when HVAC techs are installing a furnace exhaust wrong ... and it works because the service calls keep coming.

Dump your fuzzy syrup-picture AI  
================================

**Knock off the fuzzification!**

Plumbing has always been about covering up stuff so that nobody knows how that shit goes together.  It's the same with stuff like artificial intelligence or maybe worse. 

Actually, it's pretty simple ... creVass AI is about SIMPLIFICATION, which is tough for people to understand because people like believing things are more complicated than they are.

*Stop just repeating those idiotic excesses of conventional AI approaches.* creVass is not about a text-to-picture app that draws a diagram of how you are going to murder the dumbass who installed your furnace exhaust bassackward!

Just assess the situation, take some readings, learn how to turn that multimeter on and put batteries in, use the right end of a screwdriver and try to deal with Reality as Reality really is ... and laugh about the NATE-certified idiots out there smoking dope on their way to service calls and using engineering instructions as kneepads because they can't focus on anything long enough to read it.

Mostly, creVass is about helping you to just **THINK** ... to relax and just THINK about what you are doing, *WHY you are doing it,* **WHY you're a loser and your life is fucked and you are always going to be stuck doing this!** 

No ... stop it!  THINK with intention and discipline. Think outside the fast-food schlocky bun, don't overprocess or *lay on that extra sauce* to obfuscate with irrelevant data ... don't just swallow the same old s*** ... think *fast* ... *remove*, **Remove,** **REMOVE!!!**

When you are done removing, take a nap, go for a walk, meditate ... then come back and REMOVE SOME MORE ... and then polish and shine and polish and shine and polish and shine to and make sure the smell is gone and the flow will scour clean.

PRACTICAL troubleshooting and solving REAL problems is about using clarity to remove ADDICTION ... bad data just like extra drugs makes addiction, the side-effects and the addictions to the drugs for the side-effects worse ... **GET CLEAN** *or die*.


Genuine intelligence all comes down to the CLEAVAGE of REMOVAL.
===============================================================

Stop searching for another obfuscation, another imaginary fix, another drug, another product, another comfortable addiction. If you want to REALLY get at the solution a problem, you cannot simply cover it or worse automate your the covering in your litter box.

You must start by removing, CLEAVING, hack stuff out of the away to get down to where the VALUE is ... getting down in the Big V is about what really understanding what is making things smell.

After you actually understand the problem ... don't cover it up with a bandaid ... cleaning it up, polish it, make it shine so that you can see what is not shining ... make it extra CLEAN, extra shiny so that it is scrubbale and MAINTAINABLE.
People want to crap in something that is CLEAN, tightly refactored and and something that can get even CLEANER with more use.

GET DOWN INTO THE INTERNALS
===========================


You have to get down into the deep Whys of why things happen ... or, else you're just fuzzying up your networks of neurotic neurosis ... putting your diffuser bandaid on things does not reveal anything -- you're transforming the problem into a more impenetrable clusterfuck of complexification ... it might be ugly, but somebody is going to have to clean up the mess you  made!

Stop making all kinds of things worse with your ARTIFICIAL intelligence ... everyone can see that sort of intelligence is completely artificial in so many different dimensions ... knock it the fuck off with the obfuscations already.

Think *fast* ... *remove*, **Remove,** **REMOVE!!!**
