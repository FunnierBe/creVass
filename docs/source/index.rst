Welcome to the Plumbers creVass!
================================

PRACTCIAL troubleshooting ... the depths of artificial intelligence is all about CLEAVAGE ... if you want to solve a problem, you start by removing, CLEAVING, hack stuff out of the away ... get down to where the VALUE is ... what's the Big V ... what makes the s*** you want actually happen.

Do not repeat the excesses of other AI approaches ... remove, remove, remove ... then clean it up and make it pretty.

You have to get down into the deep Whys of why things happen ... or, else you're just putting a diffuser bandaid on things -- you're transforming the problem into a more impenetrable clusterfuck of complexification ... it might be ugly, but somebody is going to have to do it!

GET DOWN INTO THE INTERNALS.

Stop making it worse with your ARTIFICIAL intelligence ... everyone can see your intelligence is completely artificial ... knock it the fuck off already.
