Welcome to the Plumbers creVass!
================================

PRACTICAL troubleshooting ... the depths of artificial intelligence is all about CLEAVAGE ... if you want to solve a problem, you start by removing, CLEAVING, hack stuff out of the away ... get down to where the VALUE is ... the Big V is about what makes the s*** you want actually happen.

Do not repeat the excesses of other AI approaches ... *remove, remove,* ***REMOVE*** ... then clean it up, polish and make it CLEAN and shiny ... nobody want's your complicated fir-lined syrup-picture AI.  

People want to crap in something that is CLEAN and stays CLEAN.

You have to get down into the deep Whys of why things happen ... or, else you're just fuzzying up your networks of neurotic neurosis ... putting your diffuser bandaid on things does not reveal anything -- you're transforming the problem into a more impenetrable clusterfuck of complexification ... it might be ugly, but somebody is going to have to clean up the mess you  made!

GET DOWN INTO THE INTERNALS.

Stop making it worse with your ARTIFICIAL intelligence ... everyone can see your intelligence is completely artificial ... knock it the fuck off with the obfuscations already.
