Welcome to the Plumbers creVass!
================================

*CLEAN IT UP! *Wipe out the problems ... before you add the layers of perfume.*

*Digest, annotate, simplify, revise, refactor and generally* **improve your curated data!**

Do **not** fuzz up or diffuse your images, audio, text, smells, or tastes.

Dump neurofuzzy syruppy-picture AI  
==================================

*Stop repeating the idiotic excesses of conventional AI approaches.

Think outside the bun, don't overprocess or *lay on that extra sauce* to obfuscate with irrelevant data ... *remove*, **Remove,** **REMOVE!!!**

When you are done removing, take a nap or two, then come back and REMOVE SOME MORE ... and then polish and shine and polish and shine and polish and shine to and make sure the smell is gone and the flow will scour clean.

PRACTICAL troubleshooting and solving REAL problems is about using clarity to remove ADDICTION ... bad data just like extra drugs makes addiction, the side-effects and the addictions to the drugs for the side-effects worse ... **GET CLEAN** *or die*.

Stop searching for another obfuscation, another imaginary fix, another drug, another product, another comfortable addiction.

Genuine intelligence all comes down to the CLEAVAGE of REMOVAL.
===============================================================

If you want to REALLY get at the solution a problem, you cannot simply cover it or worse automate your the covering in your litter box.

You must start by removing, CLEAVING, hack stuff out of the away to get down to where the VALUE is ... getting down in the Big V is about what really understanding what is making things smell.

After you actually understand the problem ... don't cover it up with a bandaid ... cleaning it up, polish it, make it shine so that you can see what is not shining ... make it extra CLEAN, extra shiny so that it is scrubbale and MAINTAINABLE.
People want to crap in something that is CLEAN, tightly refactored and and something that can get even CLEANER with more use.

You have to get down into the deep Whys of why things happen ... or, else you're just fuzzying up your networks of neurotic neurosis ... putting your diffuser bandaid on things does not reveal anything -- you're transforming the problem into a more impenetrable clusterfuck of complexification ... it might be ugly, but somebody is going to have to clean up the mess you  made!

GET DOWN INTO THE INTERNALS
===========================

Stop making it worse with your ARTIFICIAL intelligence ... everyone can see your intelligence is completely artificial ... knock it the fuck off with the obfuscations already.
