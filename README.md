creVass - Social Plumbing
=========================

All of what human technology is about abstractions on top of abstractions on top of more abstractions. AI is not any different from plumbing ... it's not that the stuff is actually smart -- the stuff is obfuscations on top top of obfuscations on top of obfuscation.  

People want the EASY button ... they just want to call a plumber and have their plumbing or HVAC issue handled, because they believe in the fallacy that "I'm a professional -- I work hard as a professional to pay for plumbers to come over so that my pipes don't freeze and I can crap in water without ever having to think about any part of my biological functions"  

The SAME thing applies to all other human technology ... but now, the habit of detail hiding is so deeply ingrained that people even believe they can use the same approach when it comes their bodies, their health/fitness, their doctors appointments, the pills they swallow, their personal security or self-defense, their lives ... they are highly-specialized PROFESSIONALS who do not want to be bothered with the nasty details on which their lives depends. 

**creVass RSSistant**

Here's a HINT ... *READ MORE, a lot more and understand what you read by taking responsibility for the details ... understand root cause ... especially the details of your life.*

The social creVass RSSsistant is an AI-driven intelligence gathering tool ... it's open source, so that you can dogfood your your own intelligence gathering process, including the AI that assists you.

The RSSistant navigation interface will be troubleshooting knowledge-graph ... with relevant links to lots of schematics, data sheets, informed commentary along with your own annotations.

The creVass RSSistant will be completely open source for your development and refinement ... developing creVass will teach you something about artificial intelligence, something about plumbing/HVAC and A LOT about what kind of stuff you just take for granted without really knowing how it works. 

As with plumbing, HVAC and artificial intelligence, the whole exercise is bound to be humbling, disgusting and highly informative ... you can either do it OR you can't.

It is not going to be easy ... YOU will control the development of your RSSistant as well as the AI infrastructure-as-code which feeds data to your navigational knowledge graph ... you can host the infrusture from your box, laptop, IoT device or even just your Linux/Android phone.

It's not really any different than the detailed technical information undperinning those engineering handbook and installation instructions which get folded up and used by HVAC installers as kneepads ... most people do not want to know how incredibly fucked up their plumbing/HVAC system is ... for the same reason that people do not want to bother to delve into the realm of artificial intelligence ... and the whole strategy of ditching your responsibility for how your stuff works because your financial accounts keep getting harvested as the service calls keep coming because of your recalcitrant ignorance of things that affect your life.

You do not have to live in the dark ... you can actually start learning how to get down to root cause and actually FIX this so that it stays fixed ... along the way, maybe we can ask ourselves why we thought that complexicating and hiding shit was a good idea *but let's not get too political, right off the bat ...*.

Do not use fuzzy syrup-picture AI  
==========+======================

**Knock off all fuzzification!**  UNDERSTAND root cause from first principles ... ultimately, understanding how the world works will take you down to ab initio chemistry, particle physics and things like string theory.

Plumbing has always been about covering up stuff so that nobody knows how that shit goes together.  It's the same with stuff like artificial intelligence or maybe worse. 

Actually, it's pretty simple ... creVass AI is about SIMPLIFICATION, which is tough for people to understand because people like believing things are more complicated than they are.

*Stop just repeating those idiotic excesses of conventional AI approaches.* creVass is not about a text-to-picture app that draws a diagram of how you are going to murder the dumbass who installed your furnace exhaust bassackward!

You start where you start ... whereever that is ... maybe you want to delve into natural language processing, transformer and diffuser models, tokenizers first -- that's fine, but AI will only give you the appearance of understanding something, without having a clue about how it works from first principles.

Before long you will also have to spend some time understanding the troubleshooting diagram in your owner's manual OR you might have to find your owner's manual ... then you might learn how to turn that multimeter on and put batteries in OR use the right end of a screwdriver OR understand how pressure switches work and how to check that with your manometer or how a manometer works

By focusing on the root cause and multiple levels of WHYs behind the intensely practical DETAILS in your life ... you will START to learn things that will help you try to deal with Reality as Reality really is.

creVass is deeper than you want
===============================

Most people desperately want to imagine that they are highly specialized PROFESSIONALS who do not have to bother with the details of their lives.

creVass is about making you uncomfortable ... DEVELOPING creVass is all about helping you to just **THINK.** 

PRACTICAL troubleshooting and solving REAL problems is about using clarity to remove ADDICTION ... bad data just like extra drugs makes addiction, the side-effects and the addictions to the drugs for the side-effects worse ... **GET CLEAN** *or die*.


Genuine intelligence first involves REMOVAL
===========================================

Artificial intelligence never provides any legitimate answers ... because NOBODY really wants to check an AI algorithm's math, ie they want to make horrendoously incorrect, ridiculously generous assumptions and then kick off a complexicated AI model running on rooms full of GPUs ... this is why, UNLESS people are more genuinely curious and ask more levels of WHY, they will be like part-swapping flunkees who never actually understand how things work ... in other words, it's now safe to predict that the more that AI is used, the more irrelevance it will produce because it will enable people to distract themselves from having a clue about what's actually going on ... just like bad design engineering or parts swappers, AI will just bolt on another set of parts like more combustion air inducers, pressure switches, sensors and control boards which prevent people from understanding how gas burns in their homes.


GET DOWN INTO THE INTERNALS
===========================


You have to get down into the deep Whys of why things happen ... or, else you're just fuzzying up your networks of neurotic neurosis ... putting your diffuser bandaid on things does not reveal anything -- you're transforming the problem into a more impenetrable clusterfuck of complexification ... somebody is going to have to clean up the complexicated mess you made ... so knock it the fuck off with the obfuscations already.

Think *fast* ... *remove*, **Remove,** **REMOVE!!!**
